# Outline
  
*Summary*  
This Final Project is aimed to tell people the story of the graduates from CMU and the information industries to help students develop a better career plan in the future.
  
*Structure*  
I will focus on their majors and career situation after they graduated.
Information will include graduates' majors,

occupation choices,  
![Industries](Images/Common%20Industries%20by%20Major.png)  
and their average salaries.  
![Salary](Images/Common%20Jobs%20by%20Major.png)  
Those information will be analysed based on gender, major, and race.  
Because I am a student in Heinz College, after the introduction to graduates' major and career, I will dig geeper into the information indulstries, compare our graduates information to other graduates from different universities, and the overall information in the information indulstry. I reckon that, after more stories about the information indulstries, the Heinz students will learn more about our future career, and develop a better career plan.
